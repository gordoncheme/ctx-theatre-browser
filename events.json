It&rsquo;s Christmas Eve in the Lone Star state and radio station personalities Thurston Wheelis and Arles Struvie report local news on the Yuletide activities that have gripped their little whistle-stop of Tuna, the third smallest town in Texas, where the Lion's Club is too liberal, and Patsy Cline never dies. What&rsquo;s to be done about Joe Bob Lipsey&rsquo;s disastrous Christmas Carol pageant, a sabotaged yard-decorating contest, and a mysterious phantom on the loose and spreading havoc? With quick-change zaniness and quicksilver one-liners, CTC all-star actors Scot Friedman and Rick Smith introduce us to twenty-two of the wildest citizens of one zany town bringing all the &ldquo;joy to the world&rdquo; that make the holidays so special.

The plays are at once an affectionate comment on small-town, southern life and attitudes, but also a withering satire of the same. For each show, the original writing is notable in that two men play the entire cast of over twenty characters of multiple genders, ages, and eccentricities. The first play, <em>Greater Tuna, </em>debuted in 1981 in Austin, Texas with <em>A Tuna Christmas</em> debuting in 1989. Jaston Williams and Joe Sears regularly tour the country to perform all four plays, with Ed Howard directing. Sears and Williams did command performances of both <em>Greater Tuna</em> and <em>A Tuna Christmas</em> at the White House for President George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Tuna Christmas</strong> will once again pair up the dynamic duo Scot Friedman and Rick Smith, who appeared opposite of each other as Felix and Oscar in the highly successful <em>The Odd Couple</em>, as well as appearing together in the Austin Critic&rsquo;s Table Award nominated <em>The Seafarer </em>and<em> It&rsquo;s Only a Play. </em>The production is directed by Artistic Director Andy Berkovsky with original staging by Robyn Conner.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Beginning its 20<sup>th</sup> Season, City Theatre is an Austin-based, not-for-profit arts organization and is sponsored in part by the Austin Creative Alliance and the Cultural Arts Division of the City of Austin.

It’s Christmas Eve in the Lone Star state and radio station personalities Thurston Wheelis and Arles Struvie report local news on the Yuletide activities that have gripped their little whistle-stop of Tuna, the third smallest town in Texas, where the Lion's Club is too liberal, and Patsy Cline never dies. What’s to be done about Joe Bob Lipsey’s disastrous Christmas Carol pageant, a sabotaged yard-decorating contest, and a mysterious phantom on the loose and spreading havoc? With quick-change zaniness and quicksilver one-liners, CTC all-star actors Scot Friedman and Rick Smith introduce us to twenty-two of the wildest citizens of one zany town bringing all the “joy to the world” that make the holidays so special. Oh, holy night! “A Tuna Christmas...everything you need it to be. The result is a magical Christmas experience with a sweet sense of nostalgia – theatre ‘comfort food’.” – Broadway World Austin. \"A hoot!\" - The New York Times \"The hilarity never lets up.\" - The Village Voice A Tuna Christmas is the second in a series of comedies including the hits Greater Tuna, Red, White and Tuna, and Tuna Does Vegas each set in the fictional town of Tuna, Texas. The plays are at once an affectionate comment on small-town, southern life and attitudes, but also a withering satire of the same. For each show, the original writing is notable in that two men play the entire cast of over twenty characters of multiple genders, ages, and eccentricities. The first play, Greater Tuna, debuted in 1981 in Austin, Texas with A Tuna Christmas debuting in 1989. Jaston Williams and Joe Sears regularly tour the country to perform all four plays, with Ed Howard directing. Sears and Williams did command performances of both Greater Tuna and A Tuna Christmas at the White House for President George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush. A Tuna Christmas will once again pair up the dynamic duo Scot Friedman and Rick Smith, who appeared opposite of each other as Felix and Oscar in the highly successful The Odd Couple, as well as appearing together in the Austin Critic’s Table Award nominated The Seafarer and It’s Only a Play. The production is directed by Artistic Director Andy Berkovsky with original staging by Robyn Conner. Beginning its 20th Season, City Theatre is an Austin-based, not-for-profit arts organization and is sponsored in part by the Austin Creative Alliance and the Cultural Arts Division of the City of Austin. Founded in 2006, the company has been recognized by the Austin Critics Table Awards, the B. Iden Payne Awards, the Central Texas Excellence in Theatre Awards, BroadwayWorld Austin, Central Texas Live Theatre, and has twice been voted “Best Theatre Company” by Austin American-Statesman’s Austin 360. CTC is dedicated to providing a quality, reputable, and diverse public theatre and stage entertainment experience that is accessible to all artists and the entire Austin community. CTC continues to offer its student and group discount ticket program for any show. Put a little theatre in your life!",

Developed over years of partnership with composer <a href=\"https://www.jorgesosa.com/\">Jorge Sosa</a> and librettist <a href=\"https://johndelossantos.com/\">John de los Santos</a>, this new work is a celebration of family, cultural memory, and D&iacute;a de los Muertos traditions. Ofrenda will open the 2026&ndash;2027 season, representing a major milestone for the company&mdash;it is Austin Opera&rsquo;s first commissioned work and the culmination of years of investment in developing new voices and stories that reflect Latinx communities, family, and tradition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I cannot think of a more ideal work to help us open the Butler Performance Center than <strong>Ofrenda</strong>, which has grown right here in Austin over the past three years through Jorge and John&rsquo;s work in the Residency for Latinx Creatives,&rdquo; said Annie Burridge, Austin Opera&rsquo;s General Director &amp; CEO. &ldquo;Presenting this world premiere is both a celebration of artistic innovation and an act of community representation, highlighting the power of opera to honor heritage, inspire empathy, and bring people together across cultures.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The idea for<strong> Ofrenda</strong> came to me during COVID,&rdquo; said composer Jorge Sosa. &ldquo;I wanted to write a work that centered around healing and celebrated essential workers. I was thinking about the curanderas (traditional healers) in M&eacute;xico and the mysticism that surrounds them. John de los Santos has been an incredible creative partner in developing the idiosyncrasies of the characters and the bilingual libretto. The opera reads like a hospital procedural show, mixed with a healthy dose of magical realism and high drama. The main character is Macaria, a custodian at a hospital who has an encounter with death (Se&ntilde;ora). Moved by Macaria&rsquo;s kindness, Se&ntilde;ora sheds a tear of life into Macaria&rsquo;s water bottle, giving her the power to heal anyone. But the price for such power will eventually catch up with her.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In <strong>Ofrenda</strong>, themes of remembrance, love, and healing are woven through a narrative that honors life&rsquo;s enduring connections,&rdquo; said Claudia Chapa, Austin Opera&rsquo;s Associate Director of Artistic Operations and Curator of Hispanic &amp; Latinx Programming. &ldquo;The work resonates deeply in Austin, where more than one-third of residents identify as Hispanic or Latinx, and where Austin Opera has cultivated long-term relationships with the community through programs such as Concerts at the Consulate and the Residency for Latinx Creatives. As communities seek shared experiences that foster understanding and connection, Ofrenda offers a poignant reflection on the ties that bind families and cultures across generations.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In 2023, <strong>Ofrenda </strong>was selected by Austin Opera to receive financial and workshop support through its Residency for Latinx Creatives, a program funded by the Butler Fund for Spanish Programming, which focuses on nurturing new works by Latinx artists. During the residency, Austin Opera&rsquo;s artistic and administrative staff worked closely with Sosa and de los Santos. The team met regularly to provide feedback on libretto development and musical composition. A duet from the work premiered in November 2025 during Austin Opera&rsquo;s Celebrate Opera! concert, introducing audiences to the new piece. In July 2026, a weeklong workshop will be held in Austin.

The requested age for all evening shows is 13 & up. Guests must be 21 years of age or older to drink. The production of Frostbite contains theatrical fog/haze, bight lighting effects, and some loud noises.For the Kids Interactive Shows (Dec.20 & Dec.21 @ 3:30pm) – The Kids Shows are abbreviated versions of the Evening Shows, and they are specifically customized for ages 12 & below, including on-stage dancing activities and photo opportunities with the cast after the show! Show runtime for the Kids Shows is approximately 50 minutes with no intermission. Please note that each child must have a Child Ticket, and each child must be accompanied by an adult with an Adult Ticket. (Multiple children can be accompanied by one adult.) • Q: How close will the characters get to me? • Witch Says: My friends here in the Undead Woods are tricksters, but the Winterland folks are little sweeter (until I have something to say about it, muahaha). They all like to get up-close-and-personal, but they will not touch you. Please, witches, feel free to winter-act, but don’t touch them! • Q: Will there be a bar? • Witch Says: The Winter Cocktail Bar is poppin’ off this year (hey thanks, Tito). Bring some cash! I checked the spellbook, and the cauldron punch is witchin.’ • Q: Can we buy tickets at the door? • Witch Says: We will sell some limited tickets at the door, but it’s cheaper to buy online in advance! I definitely recommend buying in advance, though, since this brand new show will SELL OUT! Buy your tickets online NOW, or else we may have to say, “Boo, Felicia!” • Q: Is the venue wheelchair accessible? • Witch Says: Both the venue access and the seating are located on the ground level. Give us a heads up (info@ventanaballet.com) if you need us to designate some specific wheelchair spots for your party. We know that not all witches ride brooms, so allow us to reserve a spot for you to get the most fa-boo-lous views. Some parting words from the Witch… We’re off to see the blizzard.Get ready for all hail to break loose. - THE WITCH",

    "rss_description": "BL!NK Full Production BL!NK follows Sadie, an anxious but brilliant coder, and Natalie, her bold best friend and marketing genius, as they dream their way out of a small college town by creating a dating app designed to protect women from predators and data mining. In Act One, they pitch their idea to a skeptical investor, land a game-changing deal, and move to Silicon Valley—leaving behind Sadie’s stagnant relationship. Act Two picks up four years later. Natalie is planning her lavish wedding to Addie and growing frustrated that the now-single Sadie does not have a date. Then Sadie is swept into a whirlwind romance with Jake, a man she meets on their own app. As the wedding approaches, corporate compromises and personal heartbreak threaten their friendship, forcing both women to confront the true cost of success and what they want their futures to be.

    "rss_description": "In this brilliant and powerful drama, Sister Aloysius, a Bronx school principal, takes matters into her own hands when she suspects the young Father Flynn of improper relations with one of the male students. “All the elements come invigoratingly together like clockwork in John Patrick Shanley’s provocative new play, Doubt, a gripping story of suspicion cast on a priest’s behavior that is less about scandal than about fascinatingly nuanced questions of moral certainty. Something rare for this season: a laudable new American play.” — Variety “How splendid it feels to be trusted with such passionate, exquisite ambiguity unlike anything we have seen from this prolific playwright so far. Blunt yet subtle, manipulative but full of empathy for all sides, the play is set in 1964 but could not be more timely. In just ninety fast-moving minutes, Shanley creates four blazingly individual people. Doubt is a lean, potent drama…passionate, exquisite, important and engrossing.” — Newsday (NY) “A beautifully balanced drama. Shanley is a writer working at the top of his craft, making the most of a muted but evocative palette in the pursuit of truth’s shadows. Here, for the first time in a long time, is a play that is about something.” — Chicago Tribune “An eloquent and provocative investigation of truth and consequences.
