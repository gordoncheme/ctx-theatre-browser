It&rsquo;s Christmas Eve in the Lone Star state and radio station personalities Thurston Wheelis and Arles Struvie report local news on the Yuletide activities that have gripped their little whistle-stop of Tuna, the third smallest town in Texas, where the Lion's Club is too liberal, and Patsy Cline never dies. What&rsquo;s to be done about Joe Bob Lipsey&rsquo;s disastrous Christmas Carol pageant, a sabotaged yard-decorating contest, and a mysterious phantom on the loose and spreading havoc? With quick-change zaniness and quicksilver one-liners, CTC all-star actors Scot Friedman and Rick Smith introduce us to twenty-two of the wildest citizens of one zany town bringing all the &ldquo;joy to the world&rdquo; that make the holidays so special. Oh, holy night!</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em><strong>&ldquo;A Tuna Christmas...everything you need it to be.

The plays are at once an affectionate comment on small-town, southern life and attitudes, but also a withering satire of the same. For each show, the original writing is notable in that two men play the entire cast of over twenty characters of multiple genders, ages, and eccentricities. The first play, <em>Greater Tuna, </em>debuted in 1981 in Austin, Texas with <em>A Tuna Christmas</em> debuting in 1989. Jaston Williams and Joe Sears regularly tour the country to perform all four plays, with Ed Howard directing. Sears and Williams did command performances of both <em>Greater Tuna</em> and <em>A Tuna Christmas</em> at the White House for President George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Tuna Christmas</strong> will once again pair up the dynamic duo Scot Friedman and Rick Smith, who appeared opposite of each other as Felix and Oscar in the highly successful <em>The Odd Couple</em>, as well as appearing together in the Austin Critic&rsquo;s Table Award nominated <em>The Seafarer </em>and<em> It&rsquo;s Only a Play. </em>The production is directed by Artistic Director Andy Berkovsky with original staging by Robyn Conner.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Beginning its 20<sup>th</sup> Season, City Theatre is an Austin-based, not-for-profit arts organization and is sponsored in part by the Austin Creative Alliance and the Cultural Arts Division of the City of Austin.

    "rss_description": "“The worst Christmas of all was the year Hank got out of prison but didn’t bother to tell anybody.” - Tuna citizen, Bertha Bumiller Everything's bigger in Texas, including the folks and family we all know and love! It’s Christmas Eve in the Lone Star state and radio station personalities Thurston Wheelis and Arles Struvie report local news on the Yuletide activities that have gripped their little whistle-stop of Tuna, the third smallest town in Texas, where the Lion's Club is too liberal, and Patsy Cline never dies. What’s to be done about Joe Bob Lipsey’s disastrous Christmas Carol pageant, a sabotaged yard-decorating contest, and a mysterious phantom on the loose and spreading havoc? With quick-change zaniness and quicksilver one-liners, CTC all-star actors Scot Friedman and Rick Smith introduce us to twenty-two of the wildest citizens of one zany town bringing all the “joy to the world” that make the holidays so special. Oh, holy night! “A Tuna Christmas...everything you need it to be. The result is a magical Christmas experience with a sweet sense of nostalgia – theatre ‘comfort food’.” – Broadway World Austin. \"A hoot!\" - The New York Times \"The hilarity never lets up.\" - The Village Voice A Tuna Christmas is the second in a series of comedies including the hits Greater Tuna, Red, White and Tuna, and Tuna Does Vegas each set in the fictional town of Tuna, Texas. The plays are at once an affectionate comment on small-town, southern life and attitudes, but also a withering satire of the same. For each show, the original writing is notable in that two men play the entire cast of over twenty characters of multiple genders, ages, and eccentricities. The first play, Greater Tuna, debuted in 1981 in Austin, Texas with A Tuna Christmas debuting in 1989. Jaston Williams and Joe Sears regularly tour the country to perform all four plays, with Ed Howard directing. Sears and Williams did command performances of both Greater Tuna and A Tuna Christmas at the White House for President George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush. A Tuna Christmas will once again pair up the dynamic duo Scot Friedman and Rick Smith, who appeared opposite of each other as Felix and Oscar in the highly successful The Odd Couple, as well as appearing together in the Austin Critic’s Table Award nominated The Seafarer and It’s Only a Play. The production is directed by Artistic Director Andy Berkovsky with original staging by Robyn Conner. Beginning its 20th Season, City Theatre is an Austin-based, not-for-profit arts organization and is sponsored in part by the Austin Creative Alliance and the Cultural Arts Division of the City of Austin. Founded in 2006, the company has been recognized by the Austin Critics Table Awards, the B. Iden Payne Awards, the Central Texas Excellence in Theatre Awards, BroadwayWorld Austin, Central Texas Live Theatre, and has twice been voted “Best Theatre Company” by Austin American-Statesman’s Austin 360. CTC is dedicated to providing a quality, reputable, and diverse public theatre and stage entertainment experience that is accessible to all artists and the entire Austin community.

Rooted in Newfoundland's tradition of exaggerated, humorous, and dark storytelling, the community becomes complicit in the events, highlighting their role in witnessing and perpetuating cycles of violence and injustice. Through their rich culture and traditions, the storytellers blend ominous melodies with the warmth of a coastal community. The creative team includes Max Estudillo Cantú, scenic designer; Tiffany Yeager, costume designer; AJ Rose, lighting designer; Scott Murdock, sound designer; Colin Shay, technical director; and Emma Frances Frith, production stage manager.
